CONTRARY TO LAW.

In Criminal Case Nos. 27555 and 27557, the prosecution alleged that petitioners, during their respective tenures as municipal mayor of Taal, Batangas sometime from January 30, 1998 to July 6, 1999 and in conspiracy with Luther, acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence in violating procurement rules under RA 7160, otherwise known as the “Local Government Code of 1991” (LGC), thereby giving unwarranted benefits to Diamond Laboratories, Inc. (DLI) and causing undue injury to the government. Allegedly, petitioners made several direct purchases of medicines in the total amounts of P503,920.35 and P1,042,902.46, respectively, from DLI, a corporation owned by relatives by consanguinity of Librado, without the conduct of a competitive public bidding.


Meanwhile, in Criminal Case Nos. 27556 and 27558, the prosecution alleged that petitioners, during their respective tenures as municipal mayor of Taal, Batangas sometime from March 13, 1998 to September 1, 1999, acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence by unduly reimbursing the aggregate amounts of P27,651.83 and P170,987.66, respectively, as travel expenses in connection with unauthorized travels outside the municipality, thereby giving themselves unwarranted benefits, to the damage and prejudice of the government.

In defense, petitioners maintained that they cannot be deemed to have violated procurement rules since the purchases made from DLI can be characterized as emergency purchases from a duly licensed manufacturer; thus, dispensing with the need to conduct a competitive public bidding under the LGC. On the other hand, as to the allegedly improper reimbursement of travel expenses, petitioners claimed that their travels outside the municipality had been verbally authorized by then Governor Hermilando I. Mandanas (Mandanas) in accordance with the LGC and in any case, were subsequently ratified by him in writing. They also argued that the amounts spent for such purpose were absolutely necessary and incidental to the exercise of their public functions.

For his part, Luther asserted that he was not discharging any official administrative, or judicial functions relative to the allegedly illegal procurement as his participation was merely limited to the collection of payments on behalf of DLI.

The SB Ruling

In a Decision dated November 19, 2009, the SB found petitioners guilty beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly, sentenced each of them to suffer the following penalties: (a) in Criminal Case Nos. 27555 and 27556, for two (2) counts of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, Librado was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month to ten (10) years for each count; and (b) in Criminal Case Nos. 27557 and 27558, for two (2) counts of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, Fe was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month to ten (10) years for each count. Petitioners were also ordered to respectively pay the amounts of P27,651.83 and P170,987.66 as actual damages in favor of the Municipality of Taal, Batangas.
In Criminal Case Nos. 27555 and 27557 involving the purchase of medicines without public bidding, the SB ruled that all the elements of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 have been duly established, considering that: (a) petitioners were public officers who were performing their administrative and official functions; (b) they acted with manifest partiality in directly purchasing the medicines from DLI, a corporation owned by relatives by consanguinity of Librado, without public bidding and in violation of procurement rules; and (c) DLI was conferred with an unwarranted benefit. Meanwhile, in Criminal Case Nos. 27556 and 27558, pertaining to the improper reimbursements of travel expenses, the SB also found that all elements of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 were present since: (a) petitioners were public officers who were performing their administrative and official functions; (b) they acted with evident bad faith and gross inexcusable negligence in reimbursing their travel expenses without prior written authorization of their travels outside the municipality; and (c) the government suffered undue injury in the total amounts of P27,651.83 and P170,987.66.


For his part, Luther was acquitted on both counts of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 under Criminal Case Nos. 27555 and 27557 on account of the prosecution’s failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

Aggrieved, petitioners moved for reconsideration of the SB ruling, which was denied in a Resolution dated March 10, 2010. Undaunted, petitioners elevated the matter to the Court via a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.

The Proceedings Before the Court

In a Decision dated July 29, 2019, the Court affirmed the SB ruling in toto. Concurring with the lower court’s findings, the Court held that, for each count charged against petitioners, records substantiate the existence of all the elements of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019. Anent the direct purchase of medicines in Criminal Case Nos. 27555 and 27557, the Court sustained the finding of manifest partiality against petitioners, acting as public officers, and their giving of unwarranted benefits to a private party. It held that the existence of these elements was clearly demonstrated by their award of a procurement contract to DLI, a corporation owned and managed by relatives, without the conduct of a public bidding and without compliance with the requirements of the exceptions thereto, as mandated by Sections 356 and 366 of the LGC and pertinent provisions of its implementing rules and regulations (IRR).
On the other hand, with respect to petitioners’ reimbursements of travel expenses, the Court similarly agreed with the SB in holding that the same Was attended with evident bad faith and gross inexcusable negligence to the prejudice of the government. By statutory construction of Section 96 (b) of the LGC, the Court held that a prior written permission from the governor should be secured before any travel outside the province by a municipal mayor may be valid. As petitioners failed to comply with such requirement, their subject travels between March 13, 1998 to September 1, 1999 should be deemed unauthorized, rendering their reimbursement of travel expenses in connection therewith invalid.

Undeterred, petitioners moved for reconsideration arguing, among others, that: (a) the mere absence of a public bidding does not automatically equate to a conviction under Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, since the elements of the crime must still be proven beyond reasonable doubt; (b) prior permission through verbal means should already be deemed sufficient for purposes of travel authorization under Section 96 (b) of the LGC; and (c) in any event, they honestly believed in good faith that (1) the purchase of medicines were covered by the exceptions to public bidding, and (2) verbal permission of the questioned travels was already sufficient, which hence negated the crucial element of evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable negligence under Section 3 (e) of RA 3019.


The Court’s Ruling

Upon further review, the Court finds merit in petitioners’ motion for reconsideration.
At the onset, it must be emphasized that “an accused has in his/her favor the presumption of innocence which the Bill of Rights guarantees. Unless his/her guilt is shown beyond reasonable doubt, he/she must be acquitted. This reasonable doubt standard is demanded by the due process clause of the Constitution, which protects the accused from conviction except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and unless it discharges that burden the accused need not even offer evidence in his/her behalf, and he/she would be entitled to an acquittal.”

Guided by the foregoing considerations and as will be explained hereunder, the Court finds that petitioners’ conviction for the crimes charged must be set aside on the ground of reasonable doubt.

Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 states:

Section 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. — In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:

x x x x

(c) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.

Breaking down the above provision, the elements of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 are as follows: (a) that the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions (or a private individual acting in conspiracy with such public officers); (b) that he or she acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence; and (c) that his or her action caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his or her functions.


Significantly, with respect to the second element on the three distinct modes of commission of the offense, case law expounds:

There is “manifest partiality” when there is a clear, notorious or plain inclination or predilection to favor one side or person rather than another. “Evident bad faith” connotes not only bad judgment but also palpably and patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive or ill will. It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive or self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes. “Gross inexcusable negligence” refers to negligence characterized by the want of even the slightest care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with conscious indifference to consequences insofar as other persons may be affected. (Emphases in the original)

While there is no dispute as to the existence of the first element, a closer look at the records of the case shows that the second element was not established by proof beyond reasonable doubt.

Notably, anent the second element, prevailing case law elucidates that “to constitute evident bad faith or manifest partiality, it must be proven that the accused acted with malicious motive or fraudulent intent. It is not enough that the accused violated a law, committed mistakes or was negligent in his duties. There must be a clear showing that the accused was spurred by a corrupt motive or a deliberate intent to do wrong or cause damage. Thus, as the Court explained about 20 years ago in Sistoza v. Desierto, mere bad faith or partiality per se is not enough for one to be held liable under the law since the act of bad faith or partiality must in the first place be evident or manifest.”

More pertinent to the matter of procurement, the Court, in the recent case of Martel v. People (Martel), had the occasion to emphasize that “in order to successfully prosecute the accused under Section 3 (e) of R.A. 3019 based on a violation of procurement laws, the prosecution cannot solely rely on the fact that a violation of procurement laws has been committed.” Stressing that the peculiar spirit animating RA 3019 is the prevention of graft and corruption, the Court, in Martel, thus explained that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the subject procurement was motivated by a corrupt intent to favor another or to unduly receive any pecuniary benefit. It added that “[i]t is simply absurd to criminally punish every minute mistake that incidentally caused a benefit to private parties even when these acts were not done with corrupt intent,” viz.:


Violations of R.A. 3019 must be
grounded on graft and corruption

x x x x

At this juncture, the Court emphasizes the spirit that animates R.A. 3019. As its title implies, and as what can be gleaned from the deliberations of Congress, R.A. 3019 was crafted as an anti-graft and corruption measure. At the heart of the acts punishable under R.A. 3019 is corruption. As explained by one of the sponsors of the law, Senator Arturo M. Tolentino, “[w]hile we are trying to penalize, the main idea of the bill is graft and corrupt practices. x x x Well, the idea of graft is the one emphasized.” Graft entails the acquisition of gain in dishonest ways.

In the instant case, petitioners’ act of pursuing the subject procurements was motivated not by any corrupt intent to favor one car dealer over another or to unduly receive any pecuniary benefit. Based on the evidence on record, petitioners’ actuations were simply based on their honest belief that direct procurement was legally permissible. There was no showing that graft and corruption actually transpired. x x x

x x x x

To reiterate, petitioners believed in good faith that direct purchase as the mode of procurement was justified under Section 371 of the LGC. Moreover, the procurement documents were transmitted to the Provincial Auditor of the COA prior to the procurement precisely to give the COA a chance to say if such procurement was not allowed. It was only when the COA did not give any adverse comment that the purchase proceeded. These circumstances strengthen the conclusion that petitioners were not animated by any corrupt motive.

Indeed, while public office is a public trust, the Court is called upon to retrain from interpreting the laws to effectively he a disincentive to individuals in joining the public service. It is simply absurd to criminally punish every minute mistake that incidentally caused a benefit to private parties even when these acts were not done with corrupt intent. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)

Thus, an acquittal for a charge of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 is warranted when the accused’s non-compliance with the procurement law and rules ”was motivated not by any evil scheme to profit, but by [an] honest, albeit mistaken, belief that the alternative mode of direct contracting was warranted.”


In this case, the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged acts of the accused – while violative of the procurement law and rules – were done with any corrupt intent. On the contrary, records support petitioners’ assertion that they merely mistakenly believed that the purchase of medicines was covered by the exceptions to the rule on public bidding (i.e., as emergency purchases and purchases from a duly licensed manufacturer) and that the reimbursement of their travel expenses was valid.

To recall, Section 366 of the LGC allows procurement without the benefit of public bidding in the following instances:

SECTION 366. Procurement Without Public Bidding. — Procurement of supplies may be made without the benefit of public bidding under any of the following modes:

(a) Personal canvass of responsible merchants;

(b) Emergency purchase;

(c) Negotiated purchase;

(d) Direct purchase from manufacturers or exclusive distributors; and

(e) Purchase from other government entities.
(Emphases and underscoring supplied)

To debunk the claim of manifest partiality, petitioners were able to present a Purchase Request from Dr. Adolfo Magistrado (Dr. Magistrado), the Head of the Municipal Health Office of Taal, Batangas, certifying that the need for the purchased medicines was “exceptionally urgent or absolutely indispensable to prevent imminent and real danger to, or loss of, life or property.” While said request was incomplete in details, still, the emergency nature of the questioned purchases was determined not by petitioners themselves, but by the Municipal Health Officer, who was the local official tasked to take charge and formulate measures on issues and concerns pertaining to health services. There is nothing on record which belies the credibility or authenticity of this purchase request. Neither is there any proof on record to show that petitioners merely cajoled Dr. Magistrado into issuing the said purchase request in order to accommodate DLI, which happens to be a corporation owned and managed by petitioners’ relatives. To assume that such request was only issued or that an emergency/direct purchase was resorted to just because of the relationship of DLI’s owners with petitioners would simply be speculative.

Aside from the foregoing, in maintaining that the procurements need not undergo public bidding, petitioners also presented as evidence a Resolution dated February 3, 2000 from the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon stating that DLI is a duly licensed manufacturer. To petitioners, this demonstrated their honest belief that the direct purchase of medicines pursuant to Section 366 (d) of the LGC was, in fact, permitted.

While there is no denying that the specific requirements for emergency/direct purchase under the procurement law and rules were not complied with, the evidence presented by petitioners cast reasonable doubt as to the existence of manifest partiality, as ruled to be attendant by the SB. Ultimately, upon careful reconsideration, the prosecution was not able to show by proof beyond reasonable doubt that the failure to conduct public bidding in this case was ”spurred by a corrupt or ill motive” so as to fall within the purview of the element of “manifest partiality” under Section 3 (e) of RA 3019. To reiterate, “manifest partiality” constitutes a clear, notorious, or plain inclination or predilection to favor one side or person rather than another, which was not amply shown in this case. It is also noteworthy that the prosecution did not present any evidence showing that the medicines purchased from DLI were overpriced or that there were other manufacturers offering the same for a cheaper price. Further, the fact that DLI is a corporation owned and managed by petitioners’ relatives is not enough to prove manifest partiality, and consequently convict them and in turn, make them languish in jail. As case law states, to sustain a conviction based on mere allegation of preferential treatment is constitutionally impermissible, for suppositions would not amount to proof beyond reasonable doubt by virtue of their nature as conjectural and speculative. In fact, as per prevailing jurisprudence, the Court has even stated that partiality per se is not enough for one to be held liable under the law since the act of partiality must, in the first place, be manifest.

In the same vein, there is also merit to petitioners’ contention that they honestly believed that verbal permission of their travels was already sufficient under Section 96 of the LGC.

The provision states:

SECTION 96. Permission to Leave Station. — (a) Provincial, city, municipal, and barangay appointive officials going on official travel shall apply and secure written permission from their respective local chief executives before departure. The application shall specify the reasons for such travel, and the permission shall be given or withheld based on considerations of public interest, financial capability of the local government unit concerned and urgency of the travel. Should the local chief executive concerned fail to act upon such application within four (4) working days from receipt thereof, it shall be deemed approved.

(b) Mayors of component cities and municipalities shall secure the permission of the governor concerned for any travel outside the province.

(c) Local government officials traveling abroad shall notify their respective sanggunian: Provided, That when the period of travel extends to more than three (3) months, during periods of emergency or crisis or when the travel involves the use of public funds, permission from the Office of the President shall be secured.

(d) Field officers of national agencies or offices assigned in provinces, cities, and municipalities shall not leave their official stations without giving prior written notice to the local chief executive concerned. Such notice shall state the duration of travel and the name of the officer whom he shall designate to act for and in his behalf during his absence. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

A cursory reading of the foregoing provision reveals that unlike paragraph (a), the wording of paragraph (b) does not explicitly state any qualification as to the form of permission for mayors of component cities and municipalities to travel outside the province. To the Court’s mind, such imprecise phraseology grants ostensible basis for petitioners’ plea of good faith that they honestly believed that verbal permission was already sufficient to authorize their travels.

All the more, Governor Mandanas – the authorizing officer at that time – testified that he adopted a “freedom of travel” policy during his tenure, and as such, gave blanket authority to his mayors to travel outside their respective municipalities. He also subsequently ratified the questioned travels in writing. As petitioners’ travels appeared authorized and valid, there was, likewise, basis for them to reimburse their incidental expenses. To stress, absent the crucial elements of evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable negligence, public officers cannot be held criminally liable under Section 3 (e) of RA 3019.

In any event, records show that the amounts subject of the reimbursements were indeed used for official travel to and from various government offices outside Batangas, such as the Senate, Congress, Department of Interior and Local Government, Department of Agriculture, Department of Public Works and Highways, and the National Economic Development Authority. In fact, itineraries of travel, certificates of appearance, and receipts of payments were attached to the disbursement vouchers that petitioners approved. Thus, as the amounts were necessary and incidental to the exercise of public functions, it cannot be concluded that they redounded to petitioners’ undue personal benefit.

That being said, it is unnecessary to discuss the existence of the third element, as the absence of the second element, as herein discussed, is already sufficient to acquit.

All told, for failure of the prosecution to prove petitioners’ guilt for each of the charges under Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 beyond reasonable doubt, their conviction for the crimes charged must be set aside. Verily, the Court must meticulously examine the established facts through the lens of the elements of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019. Thus, as held in People v. Pallasigue, “the alleged irregular or anomalous act or conduct complained of under RA 3019 must not only be intimately connected with the discharge of the official functions of accused. It must also be accompanied by some benefit, material or otherwise, and it must have been deliberately committed for a dishonest and fraudulent purpose and in disregard of public trust.

As a final word, it bears emphasizing that no less than our Constitution guarantees the basic and indefeasible right to a presumption of innocence to all citizens, including public officers. It is well-settled that the evidence adduced against the accused must be closely examined under the lens of the judicial microscope and that the conviction flows only from the moral certainty that guilt has been established by proof beyond reasonable doubt. When such high standard is not met – as in this case – the Court is bound to rule in favor of the accused and accordingly acquit them.

WHEREFORE, the motion for reconsideration is GRANTED. The Decision dated November 19, 2009 and the Resolution dated March 10, 2010 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case Nos. 27555, 27556, 27557, and 27558 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Consequently, petitioners Librado M. Cabrera and Fe M. Cabrera are ACQUITTED of the crimes charged for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

Let the corresponding entry of judgment be issued immediately.

SO ORDERED.
